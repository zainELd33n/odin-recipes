    <p>Pumpkin pie rules the Thanksgiving dessert table. Those warming spices! That creamy pumpkin! That buttery crust! Plain pumpkin pie is clearly a classic for a reason, but it's also a great base for getting creative. That's why for Thanksgiving this year, Allrecipes challenged five of our favorite bakers with leveling up our simple pumpkin pie recipe. Developed by BobAltman in 2019, the recipe only has five ingredients: an unbaked pie crust, pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice. It's as basic as it comes. So with a blank canvas, what did our bakers come up with? First, we need the rules.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps :</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on a baking sheet.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the top of a double boiler. To melt the finely-chopped chocolate in the microwave, melt it in a microwave-proof bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between intervals. Take care not to overheat, which will cause the chocolate to burn and become grainy. Set the melted chocolate aside while preparing the remainder of the pie filling.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; mix until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Measure ½ cup of the pumpkin pie filling and stir it into the bowl of melted chocolate until smooth.
        <br><br>
        <li>Pour the remaining pie filling into the pie shell. Dollop the chocolate pie filling on top. Use a toothpick or butter knife to create a marbled effect by swirling in and out of each of the dollops.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to bake until filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes.Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
